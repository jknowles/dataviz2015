Edward Tufte reminds you: \footnote{\url{http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be}}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Have a properly chosen format and design
\item
  Use words, numbers and drawing together
\item
  Reflect balance, proportion, and a sense of relevant scale
\item
  Display an accessible complexity of detail
\item
  Have a anarrative quality, tell a story about the data

  \begin{marginfigure}
   \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/introplot-1.pdf}
  \caption{Sometimes the story is very simple.}
  \end{marginfigure}
\item
  Draw in a professional manner, with the technical details done with
  care
\item
  Avoid content-free decoration, including \textbf{chartjunk}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planning}\label{planning}

Data visualization is a tool for communicating \textbf{a specific
feature} of a dataset in an approachable and efficient
manner.\marginnote{
Data visualization is done in service of the audience. If the goal is not to convey 
information, it is art!}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Who is the audience? What is their background? Their biases?
\item
  What is the context? What would the user consider to be \emph{good
  news}, what would be \emph{bad news}? How different are these?
\item
  What does the design style say?

  \begin{marginfigure}
   \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/badexcel-1.pdf}
  \caption{Theme says a lot. This says: `I am in a hurry'.}
  \end{marginfigure}
\item
  Are you designing this visualization for a specific data set, or to
  display different data in a dashboard environment?
\item
  How long will this visualization last? Will it be updated next year?
\item
  Does it need to be interactive?
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure*}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/widesmallmultiples-1.pdf}
\caption{Small multiples spread the data out. But be careful, can the user draw meaningful distinctions between the groups from the data alone?}
\end{figure*}

How you turn dimensions in the into visual cues for your audience is
everything.

\subsection{Dimensionality}\label{dimensionality}

\emph{If you got big data, I feel sorry for you son. I got 99 problems
but data viz ain't one.} \footnote{(adapted from Jay-Z, 2003)}

\begin{figure*}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/bigplot-1.pdf}
\caption{Combine context and strategies to make comparisons easier for the user.}
\end{figure*}

\marginnote{If each point has too much weight, use transparency or the alpha 
channel to make them weigh less. This shows uncertainty and deemphasizes outliers 
visually.}

\section{Review}\label{review}

\textbf{Before you submit, check that you have:}
\marginnote{Add reference lines and annotate your charts with text. Tell the viewer,
 don't expect them to reach the same conclusion as you naturally.}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{Axis labels} and a \textbf{title}: Is your purpose clear?
\item
  A \textbf{legend}: Are all symbols explained?
\item
  A \textbf{scale}: Is the relation of data points clear?
\item
  \textbf{Annotations} Is there enough context? Are key points
  highlighted?
  \marginnote{Don't be afraid to model the data. A line of best fit or a smoother can provide a good summary to viewers to make comparisons across panels.}
\end{itemize}

Review this with \emph{fresh eyes}. Can someone who has not seen this
data before undertand and interpret the main story here?

Remember: If a picture is worth a thousand words, a good data
visualization must always be \emph{better than a table.}

\subsection{Technical Details}\label{technical-details}

\textbf{The final format and use case should inform the design:}

\begin{marginfigure}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/technologies-1.pdf}
\caption{An opinonated ordering of the tools available to do data viz. Not comprehensive or complete and your mileage will vary depending on your comfort with certain technologies.}
\end{marginfigure}

\textbf{Raster Files}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{jpg} , \textbf{png} , \textbf{gif}.
\item
  Fixed scale, aspect ratio, and size
\item
  Get blurry when you blow them up or stretch them
\item
  Viewable in almost any image viewing and editing system, including any
  modern web browser, PowerPoint, etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vector Files}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{pdf} and \textbf{svg}
\item
  Infinitely zoomable, adjustable on the fly
\item
  Viewable and usable in fewer systems. SVGs can be used in modern web
  browsers. PDFs included in other PDF reports.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{References}\label{references}

Some things to review.
