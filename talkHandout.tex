\section{Tufte Principles}\label{tufte-principles}

\newthought{Edward Tufte reminds you} \footnote{\url{http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be}}:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Have a properly chosen format and design
\item
  Use words, numbers and drawing together
\item
  Reflect balance, proportion, and a sense of relevant scale
\item
  Display an accessible complexity of detail\footnote{How you turn
    dimensions in the \emph{into visual cues} for your audience is
    everything.}
\item
  Have a anarrative quality, tell a story about the data
\item
  Draw in a professional manner, with the technical details done with
  care
\item
  Avoid content-free decoration, including \textbf{chartjunk}
\end{itemize}

\section{Planning}\label{planning}

Data visualization is a tool for communicating \textbf{a specific
feature} of a dataset in an approachable and efficient
manner.\marginnote{
Data visualization is done in service of the audience. If the goal is not to convey 
information, it is art!}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Who is the audience? What is their background? Their biases?
\item
  What is the context? What would the user consider to be \emph{good
  news}, what would be \emph{bad news}? How different are these?
\item
  What does the design style say?

  \begin{marginfigure}
   \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}
  \caption{This says: `I am in a hurry'.}
  \end{marginfigure}
\item
  Are you designing this visualization for a specific data set, or to
  display different data in a dashboard environment?
\item
  How long will this visualization last? Will it be updated next year?
\item
  Does it need to be interactive?
\end{itemize}

\section{Dimensionality}\label{dimensionality}

\newthought{If you got big data,} I feel sorry for you son. I got 99
problems but data viz ain't one. \footnote{(adapted from Jay-Z, 2003)}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Spread the data out
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Small Multiples} * Allow the viewer to draw comparisons across
small plots

\begin{marginfigure}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}
\caption{But be careful, can the user draw meaningful distinctions between the groups?}
\end{marginfigure}

\textbf{Reduce the ink} * Each point has too much ``weight'', so make
them weigh less

\begin{marginfigure}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}
\caption{Use the alpha channel - it is intuitive.}
\end{marginfigure}

\textbf{Add Reference Points} * Big data is overwhelming without
signposts

\begin{marginfigure}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}
\caption{Scale invites the user to make comparisons.}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Model the data
\end{itemize}

\begin{marginfigure}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}
\caption{But why invite, when you can make comparisons directly and show those instead? This figure shows only the loess curves for each subgroup on the relationship between attendance and reading scores.}
\end{marginfigure}

\section{Pre-Deployment Checklist}\label{pre-deployment-checklist}

\newthought{Before you submit}, check that you have:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{Axis labels} and a \textbf{title}
\item
  Can your audience immediately grasp the purpose?
\item
  A \textbf{legend}
\item
  Is it clear what all shapes, colors, and other \emph{dataink}
  represent?
\item
  A \textbf{scale}
\item
  Is this data showing
\item
  \textbf{Annotations}
\item
  Have you labeled with enough context? Are there too many labels?
\end{itemize}

Review this with \emph{fresh eyes}. Can someone who has not seen this
data before undertand and interpret the main story here?

Remember: If a picture is worth a thousand words, a good data
visualization must always be \emph{better than a table.}

\section{Technical Details}\label{technical-details}

The final format and use case should inform the design:

\begin{marginfigure}
 \includegraphics{talkHandout_files/figure-latex/technologies-1.pdf}
\caption{An opinonated ordering of the tools available to do data viz. Not comprehensive or complete and your mileage will vary depending on your comfort with certain technologies.}
\end{marginfigure}

\textbf{Raster Files}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{jpg} , \textbf{png} , \textbf{gif}.
\item
  Fixed scale, aspect ratio, and size
\item
  Reasonable file size
\item
  Get blurry when you blow them up or stretch them
\item
  Viewable in almost any image viewing and editing system, including any
  modern web browser, PowerPoint, etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vector Files}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \textbf{pdf} and \textbf{svg}
\item
  Infinitely zoomable, adjustable on the fly
\item
  Larger file size
\item
  Viewable and usable in fewer systems. SVGs can be used in modern web
  browsers. PDFs included in other PDF reports.
\end{itemize}
